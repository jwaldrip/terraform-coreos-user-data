# Terraform 0.7.x CoreOS UserData for CloudConfig
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/licence-MIT-blue.svg) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jwaldrip/terraform-coreos-user-data.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jwaldrip/terraform-coreos-user-data)

Terraform module that allows for configuration for CoreOS using terraform
variables. The result will be an output containing the user-data for use in
provisioning instances with any provider. In addition, the package also
validates the outputted user-data using a service hosted by the CoreOS team.

## Usage

### Basic Overview
To use the module, include it in your project and assign the variables. You can
then use the output to gather the user-data file.

```hcl
module "coreos-config" {
  source = "github.com/jwaldrip/terraform-coreos-user-data"
  var_1 = "value"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami = "ami-408c7f28"
  instance_type = "t1.micro"
  user_data = "${module.coreos-config.user-data}"
}
```

### Systemd Variable Interpolation
Terraform has an issue with interpolation of `$`. In order to get around that we do dynamic replacement of `var!` and replace it with `$`.  

##### Example:
`$public_ipv4` would be written as `var!public_ipv4`.

### Outputs
name                      | description
--------------------------|----------------------------
`module.user-data`        | user-data string

### Variables
The following variables can be used to configure the user data.
